# Project Description
The goal of the project is to create a simple and easy-to-use Password Manager.
Like many other password managers, this application will give you the ability to keep 
all of your information in one place in a secure and encrypted fashion. While it will 
not be as feature-rich as other options, it will be easily pilotable by a new user.
The application is primarily targetted at Windows and will be built using Python.

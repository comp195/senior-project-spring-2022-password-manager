# Project Description
The goal of the project is to create a simple and easy-to-use Password Manager.
Like many other password managers, this application will give you the ability to keep 
all of your information in one place in a secure and encrypted fashion. While it will 
not be as feature-rich as other options, it will be easily pilotable by a new user.
The application is primarily targetted at Windows and will be built using Python.

The program supports symmetric encryption. This ensures that the output file will be 
unable to be decrypted unless the key file accompanies it. The key file is regenerated
anytime the file is saved again.
